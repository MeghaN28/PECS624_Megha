Input
The React Native application operates without accepting changes made by users. The application implements static data through hard coding instead of accepting user entries. A text component contains each of the three pieces of information including name and degree program and school name in the source code directly. The application displays the static data points that users entered through the app interface.

Process
Core processing requires rendering the user interface through one View container alongside three Text components and a StyleSheet component which applies visual styles. The application displays a central yellow square with black text that is easy to read. The program executes without any processing of calculations or user input.

Output
The program produces a centered yellow box which shows the user information including their name "Megha" and their degree "Master in Computer Science" and their educational institution "City University of Seattle". The interface showcases basic UI elements that demonstrate how to construct a structured mobile application with informative design.
